When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to reach my work from other places or I want to share it with someone else

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it can cause the problem, while working on the same project locally

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is create a copy of someone's repositary on GitHub server.
    Clone make the copy of the repositary to the local computer.
    Branch can make differen branches in the repositary

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    "git pull" or "git fetch -> git merge -> git push" make the version on GitHub and on local computer the same.
    You always want to have the updated version of the remote depositary while working, as it can help you to avoid additional work.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We could use email, icq, skype, but it really be more complecated and timeconsuming.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
